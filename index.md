title: About me
---

I am a researcher in bioinformatics and genomics (INSERM, [IRSD](http://www.irsd.fr/)), interested in the functional annotation of genomes through the use of NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) omics data.

My research involves both method development and data analysis, for the functional annotation of genomes, mostly human and mouse, but also terrestrial livestock species (mostly chicken and pig but also cattle and goat).

As I was one of the main analysts of the first really comprehensive human NGS transcriptomic dataset (long/small, polyadenylated/non polyadenylated RNAs from 15 different cell lines and 6 different cell compartments, using RNA-seq/CAGE/RNA-PET NGS techniques), my first expertise is in RNA-seq data analysis (see also [ChimPipe](https://github.com/Chimera-tools/ChimPipe) for chimeric transcript identification).
