title: About me
---

I am a researcher in bioinformatics and genomics (INSERM, [IRSD](http://www.irsd.fr/)), interested in the functional annotation of genomes through the use of NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) omics data.

My research involves both method development and data analysis, for the functional annotation of genomes, mostly human and mouse, but also terrestrial livestock species (mostly chicken and pig but also cattle and goat).

As I was one of the main analysts of the first really comprehensive human NGS transcriptomic dataset (long/small, polyadenylated/non polyadenylated RNAs from 15 different cell lines and 6 different cell compartments, using RNA-seq/CAGE/RNA-PET NGS techniques), my first expertise is in RNA-seq data analysis (see also [ChimPipe](https://github.com/Chimera-tools/ChimPipe) for chimeric transcript identification).

Since 2015 and my involvement in the INRAE FR-AgENCODE project on livestock species, I have gained interest in regulatory genomics and in particular in the identification of enhancer/gene relationships, that can be tremendously important in the context of complex traits, both in livestock and in human.

This is a complex question and although many methods exist there is no consensus about which one performs better. In fact we have shown that depending on the kind of reference data used to evaluate the methods (3D data, eQTL data or genetic screening data), the best method could be drastically different.
