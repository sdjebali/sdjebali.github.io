I have recently (co-)organized:
* The annual French Bioinformatics Conference in June 2024 in Toulouse, [JOBIM2024](https://jobim2024.sciencesconf.org/?forward-action=index&forward-controller=index&lang=en), gathering 470 persons on site and 100 people on-line
* An INSERM workshop entitled "Massive Genomic Data: Statistical and Bioinformatics Advances", with a theoretical phase gathering 70 people in Bordeaux in September 2024 and a [practical phase](https://gitlab.com/SarahDjebali/insermmassivegenomicdata2024) gathering 23 people in Brest in October 2024
